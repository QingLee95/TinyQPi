# TinyQ minimal lightweight custom embedded linux distro
For playing and testing.

Custom Yocto layer (meta-tinyqpi) for the Raspberry Pi 4B and (later) Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.

Yocto version: **Kirkstone**

## Dependencies

- poky
- meta-openembedded
- meta-raspberrypi

*Do not change these submodules!

## TODO's

- After install move image to /artifacts
- Reduce reserved space in ext4
- Reduces tmpfs
- Use Poky-tiny
- Use core-image-minimal and build up from there (basic feature won't work anymore)
- Add libgpiod
- Strip Kernel

# How to build image

1. Pull repository -> structure of directory should be
    ```bash
    .
    ├── artifacts
    ├── build
    └── TinyQPi
        ├── activate_bb
        ├── meta-openembedded
        ├── meta-raspberrypi
        ├── meta-tinyqpi
        ├── poky
        ├── ...
        └── README.md
   ```
2. ```git submodule update --init --recursive``` in ./TinyQPi
3. ```source TinyQPi/activate_bb build``` in ./
4. ```bitbake tinyqpi4b```  in ./build

Step 4 can take a few hours!

The image will be in **./artifacts/*.sdimg** flash it to a sdcard of ssd and insert in the Raspberry Pi.

# Static ip on eth0

Add following line to **./build/conf/local.conf** when building image

```
DISTROOVERRIDE:append = ":static_eth0"
```
After this the raspberry pi will be accessible on eth0 via the static ip 192.168.1.3/24.

# Configured wifi out of the box on wlan0
Add following line to **./build/conf/local.conf** when building image

```
DISTROOVERRIDES:append = ":configured_wifi"
# Fill in wifi name
WIFI_NAME = ""
# Fill in wifi password
WIFI_PWD = ""
```

The Raspberry pi will startup with wifi already connected.

# Create SD image with swap partition

```
source sources/activate_bb 

wic create sdimage-tinyqpi -e tinyqpi4b
```
This will create a root partition + swap partition of 3GB. If you like to change the size see meta-tinyqpi/wic/sdimage-tiyqpi.wks

# TinyQPi with Hyprland 

TODO

*Incompatible with Kirkstone. Is bleeding edge
**Don't merge back to master
